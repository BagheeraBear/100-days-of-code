# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: JS/Node: Fixed remove-function with filter() as in Array.prototype.filter
C#: Work on log-functionality

**Thoughts:** Always better to think through a problem before starting to code. But then again, thinking through sometimes means coding, and testing
